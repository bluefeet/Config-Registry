# NAME

Config::Registry - Settings bundler.

# SYNOPSIS

## Create a Schema Class

```perl
package Org::Style;
use strictures 2;

use Types::Standard qw( Str );

use Moo;
use namespace::clean;

extends 'Config::Registry';

__PACKAGE__->schema({
  border_color => Str,
});

1;
```

## Create a Document Class

```perl
package MyApp::Style;
use strictures 2;

use Moo;
use namespace::clean;

extends 'Org::Style';

__PACKAGE__->document({
  border_color => '#333',
});

__PACKAGE__->publish();

1;
```

## Use a Document Class

```perl
use MyApp::Style;

my $style = MyApp::Style->fetch();

print '<table style="border-color:' . $style->border_color() . '">';
```

# SYNOPSIS

This module provides a framework for a pattern we've seen emerge in
ZipRecruiter code as we've been working to separate our monolithic
application into smaller and more manageable code bases.

The concept is pretty straightforward.  A registry consists of a
schema class and one or more document classes.  The schema is used to
validate the documents, and the documents are used to configure the
features of an application.

# SCHEMAS

```perl
__PACKAGE__->schema({
  border_color => Str,
});
```

The schema is a hash ref of attribute name and [Type::Tiny](https://metacpan.org/pod/Type::Tiny) pairs.
These pairs get turned into required [Moo](https://metacpan.org/pod/Moo) attributes when
["publish"](#publish) is called.

Top-level schema keys may have a hash ref, rather than a type, as
their value.  This hash ref will be used directly to construct the
[Moo](https://metacpan.org/pod/Moo) attribute.  The `required` option defaults on, and the `is`
option default to `ro`.  You can of course override these in the
hash ref.

For example, the above code could be written as:

```perl
__PACKAGE__->schema({
  border_color => { isa => Str },
});
```

The attribute can be made optional by passing an options hash ref:

```perl
__PACKAGE__->schema({
  border_color => { isa => Str, required => 0 },
});
```

Non-top level keys can be made optional using [Type::Standard](https://metacpan.org/pod/Type::Standard)'s
`Optional` type modifier:

```perl
__PACKAGE__->schema({
  border_colors => Dict[
    top    => Optional[ Str ],
    right  => Optional[ Str ],
    bottom => Optional[ Str ],
    left   => Optional[ Str ],
  ],
});
```

See ["Create a Schema Role"](#create-a-schema-role) for a complete example.

# DOCUMENTS

```perl
__PACKAGE__->document({
  border_color => '#333',
});
```

A document is a hash ref of attribute name value pairs.

A document is used as the default arguments when `new` is called
on the registry class.

See ["Create a Document Class"](#create-a-document-class) for a complete example.

# CLASS METHODS

## fetch

```perl
my $registry = $class->fetch();
```

Returns the singleton instance of the registry class.

# PACKAGE METHODS

## schema

```
__PACKAGE__->schema( \%schema );
```

Sets the schema hash ref.  If a schema hash ref has already been
set then ["merge"](#merge) will be used to combine the passed in schema with
the existing schema.

See ["SCHEMAS"](#schemas) for more information about the schema hash ref
itself.

## document

```
__PACKAGE__->document( \%doc );
```

Sets the document hash ref.  If a document hash ref has already been
set then ["merge"](#merge) will be used to combine the passed in document with
the existing document.

See ["DOCUMENTS"](#documents) for more information about the document hash ref
itself.

## publish

```
__PACKAGE__->publish();
```

Turns the ["schema"](#schema) hash ref into [Moo](https://metacpan.org/pod/Moo) attributes and enables the
registry class to be instantiated.
